{"body":"# A C++ library for the efficient simulation of large dynamic network models\r\nThe `largenet` library is a collection of C++ classes providing a framework for the \r\nsimulation of large discrete [adaptive networks][1]. It provides data structures\r\nfor an in-memory representation of undirected networks, in which every node and link \r\ncan have an integer-valued state.\r\n\r\nEfficient access to (random) nodes and links as well as (random) nodes and links\r\nwith a given state value is provided. A limited number of graph-theoretical measures\r\nis implemented, such as the (state-resolved) degree distributions, the clustering \r\ncoefficient, the nearest-neighbor degree correlations, and the average shortest path\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe `largenet` library has been developed mostly by [Gerd Zschaler][]\r\nbased on original ideas of [Thilo Gross][]. Most of this work is licensed under the\r\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC license. See COPYING for details.\r\n\r\nFor installation instructions, see INSTALL. For examples how to use the library, see the \r\n`examples` directory.\r\n\r\nThe `largenet` library has been used for simulations of [evolutionary games on graphs][2],\r\nadaptive network models of [swarming][3], fish [schooling][4], epidemiological models,\r\nand opinion formation models. \r\n\r\n[1]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2007.1229 \"T.
